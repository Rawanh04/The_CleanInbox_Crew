## Dataset access
This project uses the Enron Spam/Ham dataset (~341 MB).
**IT IS TOO LARGE TO STORE IN GITHUB**
Download it from:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meruvulikith/190k-spam-ham-email-dataset-for-classification

After downloading, place it in:  data/raw/spam_Emails_data.csv
Do not forget to change the path location in main.cpp, line 43!

You have to click run, wait for it to do its thing, and then click the link given by the console!
(It might take a while...)

and watch the magic happen :)
